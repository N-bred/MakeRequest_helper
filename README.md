# MakeRequest Script

This script will help you out by giving you a **ready to use** function which will accept 2 arguments, the first being the url you want to make the request to, and the second one is to declare the type of request: `GET or POST`, GET is set as the default. 

It uses the `fecth API`, the `.then` and `.catch` functions to get the data from the url.

This is by no means an advance level code, i made it because i wanted to practice requests in JS, so feel free to give some advice or even improve the code.

Best regards, N-bred.
